# Homework Instructions

Describe it as you did in the forms above: general idea, null, and alternative hypothesis. Make sure that the quantities you are using are measurable and that you are including all possible outcomes of your experiment. Write this in a HW2/README.md file in your github repository, following proper READMe syntax and formatting the sections the same way as in the forms: General Idea, Null Hypothesis, Alternative Hypothesis, comments on experimental design. To format headers in a markdown file you can use the # symbol (more # will make smaller headers).

# Are buried historical streams causing floods in Philadelphia neighborhoods above the fall line?

Philadelphia had an extensive network of streams, [even more than shown on this map](http://www.phillyh2o.org/backpages/Maps/A_HistoricStreams.jpg), many of which were buried to construct buildings and streets in Philadelphia. Data includes some more detailed historic stream maps, locations of not-buried streams, impervious surfaces, property data, flood reports from large rainfall events, and satellite imagery of inundation after extreme precipitation events.

## General idea

Flooded streets and properties in Philadelphia above the fall line correspond to the locations of buried historical streams.

## Alternative hypothesis

Streets and properties built over buried streams above the fall line in Philadelphia will have more and/or more severe floods after extreme precipitation events than similar properties and streets.

## Null hypothesis

Streets and properties built over buried streams above the fall line in Philadelphia will have the same number or fewer floods (and/or less severe floods) than similar properties and streets.

## Comments on experimental design

I thought of starting to do this analysis for my GIS class last semester, though it has nothing to do with critical minerals or mining. Also, my street on a high hill of Philadelphia flooded last September, and the corner is over a buried stream.

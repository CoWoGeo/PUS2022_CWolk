My summary of the project and paper is here! Also, I did not get to the ranking and plot for the RFs for either city. I looked in the class demonstration code and a million places online and kept trying bits of code, only to hit dead ends. I wonder if I need to merge the numerical and categorical datasets and pull the labels from them, assuming they remained in that order?

Anyway, here is my summary. Roth et al. evaluate the use of linear and non-linear models on open data to benchmark urban building energy usage and compare it to the Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS), which is the basis for Energy Star rankings. Buildings are a primary source of urban energy use and therefore greenhouse gases, but this research is also urgent because the CBECS process is time- and labor- intensive (and therefore also likely harder to scale up to include more urban buildings in energy efficiency programs). "Results demonstrate that 90% of benchmarking models using open data outperform models based on the CBECS dataset. Additionally, our results indicate that building area, property type, conditioned area, and water usage are the most important variables for cities to collect.‚Äù (Roth et al., 2019, p. 1) This is a pretty stunning number, especially given the relative simplicity of their findings. Later on, they note that advances in public data and remote sensing may make these efforts even more insightful.

(Edited to reflect progress on the homework, had done the summary on time!)

My summary of the paper:
Roth et al. evaluate the use of linear and non-linear models on open data to benchmark urban building energy usage and compare it to the Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS), which is the basis for Energy Star rankings. Buildings are a primary source of urban energy use and therefore greenhouse gases, but this research is also urgent because the CBECS process is time- and labor- intensive (and therefore also likely harder to scale up to include more urban buildings in energy efficiency programs). "Results demonstrate that 90% of benchmarking models using open data outperform models based on the CBECS dataset. Additionally, our results indicate that building area, property type, conditioned area, and water usage are the most important variables for cities to collect.‚Äù (Roth et al., 2019, p. 1) This is a pretty stunning number, especially given the relative simplicity of their findings. Later on, they note that advances in public data and remote sensing may make these efforts even more insightful.

(Monday addition: we are going through a similar process with just RF, not Lasso, as practice.)

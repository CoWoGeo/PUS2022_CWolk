This homework is about working with a shapefile, representing its contents in different ways, turning another file into point data, combining different geodatabases with a spatial join, making chloropleths, transforming coordinate systems and aligining them between two datasets, and a lot of other things that would be redundant to list.
I worked with Emmanuel and Elizabeth. We each did almost all the coding independently but talked each other through some sticking points. The big sticking points Emmanuel helped with are noted in the homework file, but Elizabeth and I figured some things out together, too, mostly in the spatial join section.
